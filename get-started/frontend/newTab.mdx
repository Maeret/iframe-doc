If a user clicks on a link inside an iframe while holding the Ctrl or Cmd key or
selects "Open link in new tab" from the context menu, they will be directed to
the parent domain of the iframe with the addition of the `path` parameter
(the link that the user clicked on in the iframe):

```
https://{domain}/b2b-frame-goto?path=https:%2F%example.com%2Fen%2Flive%2Ffootball
```

*   `domain` — the parent domain
*   `path` — the link that the user clicked on

:::info
The address of the parent domain is taken from `document.referrer`.
