## iframe cookies security issue

There is an issue with iframe cookie write access in some browsers (Safari,
Firefox). It prohibits saving a cookie until the iframe domain is opened
directly. In this instance, the browser successfully accepts cookies from the
server, but does not save them or send them back to the server with the
subsequent request.

The iframe needs write access in to function properly. To fix this, iframe have
a special mechanism: the first time a page with an iframe is opened, a special
page will be displayed to the user with a warning about the need to use cookies
and a button.

When the button is clicked, a new iframe domain page is opened with a particular
address for the test cookie to be recorded. New page is automatically closed and
the iframe is relaunched. If successful, the iframe gains cookie storage access
and redirects to the specified mechanism using the `gear` parameter, as
described [here](/frontend/API).


## Custom iframe menu

If you want to use your section switching menu instead of the default one,
please contact us. The standard menu can be disabled.


## Open in new tag

If the user clicks on links inside the iframe while holding down the Ctrl or Cmd
key (or selects "Open Link in New Tab"), they will be redirected to the iframe
parent domain.

The address of the new page will contain the link (`path`) that the user needs
to be redirected to:

```
https://{domain}/b2b-frame-goto?path={path}
```

*   `domain` — the parent domain for accessing the iframe
*   `path` — the address of the page to be redirected, for example:
    `https:%2F%example.com%2Fen%2Fwallet`

:::info
The address of the parent domain is taken from `document.referrer`.
