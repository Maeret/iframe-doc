title: iframe URL
sidebar_position: 1
hide_table_of_contents: false
---


The URL to use inside the iframe element:

```
https://{domain}/{lng}/{path}?lng={lng}&token={token}&sign={sign}
```

:::warning
URI-encode values of path parameters.
:::


### `domain`

*   required

Your domain to access the iframe.

:::info
[iframe domain](#iframe-domain).
:::


### `path`

Path to the site section that will be displayed in the iframe.

path | section name
--- | ---
| wallet           | User wallet 
| history | Payment History
| news |
| market |


### `lng`

*   required for authorized requests

ISO2 language code.

`/{lng1}?lng={lng2}`

To switch the language of the interface, use the path parameter `lng1`.
The query parameter `lng2` doesn't affect the interface language.
It's forwarded to the [Backend API](/en/category/api-backend).

If you don't provide a language in `lng1`, the iframe will determine it from the
browser settings and perform a redirect (code 302) to add the automatically
determined `lng1` value to the path.


### `token`

*   required for authorized requests

The token required to authorize the user.

By default, some sections can be viewed by an unauthorized user — for this, it
is enough not to send a `token` in the request.

> `/history` and `/wallet` are only to authorized users: only with a valid `token`.

:::info
[Authorization](/frontend/auth).
:::


### `sign`

*   required for authorized requests

Request signature.

:::info
[Signature Algorithm](#signature-algorithm).
:::


### `logout`

Initiate user logout.

`/{lng1}?logout=1`

This command attempts to log out the user, by ending their current session.
When used, the iframe transitions into a demo mode. The `token` query parameter
is not relevant in this context and will be disregarded.


### `platform_type`

The type of platform. Possible values:
*   `mobile` — to get the mobile version of the iframe
*   `desktop` — to get the desktop version of the iframe
*   not provided — the platform type will be determined automatically

The provided value is stored in the `platform_type` cookie for up to 4 days.


### `bgColor`

Background color of a widget content. Any valid value of
[`background-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color).

## iframe domain

There are 2 placement options for accessing the iframe. In both cases, the 
iframe is hosted on your domain.


**Option 1. Hosting on your subdomain**

:::note
This hosting option will save you from problems with
[recording cross-domain cookies in some browsers](/frontend/faq).
However, it depends on your registrar — some registrars do not allow you to
specify IP for subdomains.
:::

*   You have a registered domain.
*   We provide you with an IP address.
*   You register this IP on a subdomain of original domain.
*   You buy and send us an SSL certificate for this subdomain.
*   We add mirror domains on our side with provided certificate.
*   You send us new SSL certificate when the old one runs out (paid — once a
    year, free — once every 3 months).
*   We notify you when you need to change the IP on subdomains (this does not
    happen often).

**Option 2. Hosting on your domain**

*   You have a registered domain.
*   We provide you with DNS NS records.
*   You specify NS records for your domain, after that requests to the domain
    are redirected to our IP address.

## Signature algorithm

When authenticating a user with a token, you must include a signature in the
request.

The signature is formed as follows:

```
sign = md5(lng={lng}&token={token}{secret})
```

Where:
*   `secret` — a secret string provided to you when connecting to the API
*   `md5` — the function to compute the MD5 hash of a string

:::caution
The order of parameters when forming the signature string is strictly fixed.
Please adhere to the specified order as shown above.
:::

When transforming parameter values, ensure compliance with
[RFC 1738](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738).

```php title="Example"
<?php
/*

*  domain:'https://iframe.com'
*  token: '1q2w3e'
*  lng: 'ru'
*  secret: 'test_secret'

*/


$params = ['lng'=> 'en', 'token' => '1q2w3e'];
$params['sign'] = md5(http_build_query($params).'test_secret');

// $src = 'https://iframe.com/en?lng=en&token=1q2w3e&sign=3ec84273bf0043d4936a8486b8741bb7'
$src = 'https://iframe.com/en'?.http_build_query($params);
?>

<iframe src="<?= $src; ?>"></iframe>
```
