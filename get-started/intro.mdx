This API will let you embed the contents of the wallet provider's website in an iframe 
element in your web application. The iframe element is hosted as an independent
HTML document with its own browsing context. Your users will be able to log in
to the wallet provider's application and place payment. Their credentials will be stored
on your side. 

The API uses callbacks to your server to provide communication between the
wallet provider service and your user database.

*   The [API frontend](/category/api-frontend) section
    describes how to include an iframe element in your application code.
*   The [API backend](/category/api-backend) section describes requests from the
    wallet provider's server to your app, which let the wallet provider get your user data,
    authorize users, place and calculate their payment.

This iframe URL does not accept a `token` and does not cause it to be checked,
as [explained here](/frontend/auth), so the user is not required to register or
authorize in order to navigate between sections of the website. In addition, it
does not require any other [mandatory parameters](/frontend/API). You can use
this widget in your application.

In addition, the iframe you'll set up in [this tutorial](/frontend/API) has the
option to disable (separately) user token authorization, the registration
button, and the top menu. Please contact us to do so.
