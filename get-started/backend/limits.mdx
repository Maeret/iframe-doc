You can implement several types of payment limits on your service and return the
corresponding error to us if the user reaches the limit.

If your service returns one of these errors when accepting a payment, the wallet provider
service will return an error. The payment will not be placed.

:::note
All listed error codes errorCode should be returned in the response of the
[**MakePayment**](/backend/API#operation/MakePayment) method for a payment
[transaction](/backend/payments#payment-acceptance) with **`type: payment`**.
:::

*   `6` — limit on the amount of a single payment. The user has reached the limit of
    the amount of a single payment, so the payment for the current amount cannot be
    placed.
*   `7` — daily limit on the total amount of payment. The user has reached the
    limit of the total amount of payment per day, so the current payment cannot be
    placed.
*   `8` — debt limit. The user has reached the limit of the amount of lost
    funds, so the current payment cannot be placed.
*   `9` — self-imposed limit. The user has set a limit on the amount of payment and
    exceeded the limit, so the current payment cannot be placed. 
  
    :::note
    The mechanism for setting self-restrictions is implemented on your side.
    :::

*   `10` — unverified user profile. The user's profile has unverified data, such
    as not uploaded documents confirming their identity.

    :::note
    The verification mechanism is implemented on your side.
