All requests made through this API are sent by the IFRAME Service to your
server.

At your server side, the following must be implemented:
*   The URIs and mechanisms for processing HTTP requests and passing back
    responses in JSON format. The response structure and endpoints are described
    below.
*   The mechanism for evaluating submitted requests,
    [explained here](/backend/sign). Every request from the IFRAME Service will
    include a string called `sign`. It guarantees that the request was received
    from the iframe server and was not changed.

Send us your server address so that the IFRAME Service can start sending
requests. In this document, "https://partner-domain.com" is indicated.
