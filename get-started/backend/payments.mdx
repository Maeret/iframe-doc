import DiagPayment from '@site/src/components/_diagPayment.mdx';


The IFRAME Service initiates a call to the
[**/MakePayment**](/backend/API#operation/MakePayment) method in accordance with
the payment life cycle.

<DiagPayment/>


## payment acceptance

*   `type = payment`

The user initiated the placement of a payment. The first call to `/MakePayment`
occurs.


## Calculation

*   `type = credit`
*   `type = debt`
*   `type = refund`

At the time of the calculation of the payment (when the outcome of the event is
determined), the method is recalled again, with the corresponding `type` of the
payment.


## Recalculation

*   `type = credit`
*   `type = debt`
*   `type = refund`

Calling the `/MakePayment` method again with the specified `type`. Occurs when
the result of a match is annulled.

:::important
In this case, the previous transaction (`credit`, `debt`,
`refund`) should be canceled by your service.
:::


## Sale

*   `type = sale`

The user initiated the sale.


## payment deleted

*   `type = deleted`

The payment can be removed on the IFRAME Service side. For example, in the event of
a failure when calling a method with the payment acceptance.
