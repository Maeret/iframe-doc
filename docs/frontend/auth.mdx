The user token needed to access the iframe's sections is generated
**on your side**.

Your service passes the user token in the iframe URL request.
After that, the wallet provider's service calls
[**GetUserData**](/backend/API#operation/GetUserData) with the received
`token1`.

The API expects a `200` response from your service with user data in the
response body and no `errorCode`. This response verifies that the token exists
and that a user account exists for it on your side. The iframe URL request is
authorized.
